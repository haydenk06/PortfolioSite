					<h1>Hi, Thanks for visiting my site!</h1>
					<p> A 2020 graduate of Western Governor’s University with a bachelor’s degree in Software Development. I have spent the last three years working towards a career change from hair stylist to developer. As a junior developer I have worked on many projects including applications written with Java, Android mobile and Web design. More recently I have been studying Node.js. I acquired project and time management skills, as well as self-discipline, problem solving and communication compentecy though the completion of an online degree, projects and leadership roles in my current career.</p>
					<p>I Hope to enter into software development and continue learning more programming languages and design. Dabbling with code since late 90's, this change will further ignite my passion and curiosity for coding and software design.</p>
					<p> These days I enjoy spending any free time with my white German Shepherd (Schultz) while hiking, camping and kayaking. During the rainy Oregon winter I enjoy crafting, collecting house plants and reading anything Adult or YA fantasty and sci-fi.</p>
					<p>I am currently Located near Portland, Oregon and always available to discuss opportunities for work over email or the phone.</p>
